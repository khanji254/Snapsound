# Arduino Sound-Activated Projects

Welcome to the Arduino Sound-Activated Projects repository! This repository contains Arduino sketches for creating interactive projects using sound sensors and relay modules. These projects are designed to detect sound events and respond to them, whether it's by counting, blinking an LED, or controlling external devices.

## Project Descriptions

### 1. Snapsound Incremental Counter

- **Code:** `Snapsound_Incremental_Counter.ino`
- **Description:** This project demonstrates how to use an Arduino to incrementally count the number of sound events (snaps or claps) using a sound sensor. The code tracks and displays the total number of sound events.

### 2. Snapsound On/Off Switch

- **Code:** `Snapsound_On_OffSwitch.ino`
- **Description:** In this project, we use a sound sensor to control an on/off switch, allowing you to turn on or off external devices based on sound input. The code includes debounce functionality to prevent multiple rapid detections.

### 3. Snapsound Calibrate

- **Code:** `Snapsound_Calibrate.ino`
- **Description:** This project provides calibration functionality for fine-tuning your sound sensor. Use this code to adjust sensitivity and threshold levels for sound detection.

### 4. Snapsound Analogue Input - Raw Data

- **Code:** `Snapsound_AnalogueInput_RawData.ino`
- **Description:** This project captures and displays raw data from the sound sensor's analog output. It's a valuable tool for analyzing sound sensor behavior.

### 5. Snapsound Snap Counter

- **Code:** `Snapsound_Snap_Counter.ino`
- **Description:** Building upon the Snapsound Incremental Counter project, this enhanced version resets the snap count after blinking an LED. It's ideal for counting sound events at irregular intervals and visually representing the count.

## Getting Started

- To get started with any of these projects, you'll need an Arduino board, a sound sensor, a relay module (for some projects), an LED, and a power source.
- Download the respective Arduino sketch and upload it to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
- Monitor the project's behavior and snap or clap to trigger the sound-activated actions.

## Dependencies

These projects require basic knowledge of Arduino programming and may use external libraries for specific components (e.g., sound sensors). Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed.

## Contribution and Issues

Feel free to contribute to this repository by sharing your modifications, improvements, or new sound-activated projects. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for enhancements, please create an issue in the repository.

Enjoy tinkering with Arduino and exploring the world of sound-activated projects!
