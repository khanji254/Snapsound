# Arduino Sound-Activated Projects

Welcome to the Arduino Sound-Activated Projects repository! This repository contains Arduino sketches for creating interactive projects using sound sensors and relay modules. These projects are designed to detect sound events and respond to them, whether it's by counting, blinking an LED, or controlling external devices.

## Project Descriptions

### 1. Sound-Activated LED Counter

- **Code:** `sound_activated_led_counter.ino`
- **Description:** This project demonstrates how to use an Arduino to count the number of sound events (snaps or claps) using a sound sensor. The code tracks and displays the total number of sound events and blinks an LED to represent the count.

### 3. Enhanced Sound-Activated LED Counter

- **Code:** `enhanced_sound_activated_led_counter.ino`
- **Description:** Building upon the Sound-Activated LED Counter project, this enhanced version resets the snap count after blinking the LED. It's ideal for counting sound events at irregular intervals and visually representing the count.

## Getting Started

- To get started with any of these projects, you'll need an Arduino board, a sound sensor, a relay module (for the second project), an LED, and a power source.
- Download the respective Arduino sketch and upload it to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
- Monitor the project's behavior and snap/clap to trigger the sound-activated actions.

## Dependencies

These projects require basic knowledge of Arduino programming and may use external libraries for specific components (e.g., sound sensors). Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed.

## Contribution and Issues

Feel free to contribute to this repository by sharing your modifications, improvements, or new sound-activated projects. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for enhancements, please create an issue in the repository.

Enjoy tinkering with Arduino and exploring the world of sound-activated projects!

Happy coding!
